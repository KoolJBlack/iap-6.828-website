Description
-----------

Caffienated 6.828 is a fast-paced whirlwind introduction to operating
systems, aimed at giving students an as-close-as-possible to an
authentic 6.828 experience during an IAP term. The MIT course catalog
lists 6.828 as:

Prereq: 6.033, and 6.170 (and, by implication, 6.004) G (H), 3-6-3, 6 EDP

6.828 studies fundamental design and implementation ideas in the
engineering of operating systems. Lectures are based on a study of
UNIX and research papers. Topics include virtual memory, threads,
context switches, kernels, interrupts, system calls, interprocess
communication, coordination, and the interaction between software and
hardware.  Individual laboratory assignments involve implementation of
a small operating system in C, with some x86 assembly.

Who should take Caffienated 6.828?
----------------------------------

Caffienated 6.828 is primarily focused on graduating Seniors and
M.Eng. students that did not have an opportunity to take the
full-fledged 6.828 class in Fall 2013. We encourage anyone that has
the opportunity to take the full 6.828 at a later date to do so even
if they have completed this course for credit.

Communication
-------------

We will distribute assignments on the [course web
site](http://sipb.mit.edu/iap/6.828). All announcements will be posted
on the course web site in addition to being sent via email.

Grading policy
--------------

Grades in Caffienated 6.828 will be awarded P/NR, based on the results
the lab assignments. You must complete all lab assignments
satisfactorily to receive a passing grade. There will be an optional,
but highly recommended, final mini-project. There will be no exam.

Labs
----

To turn-in the labs, run `make handin` in your lab directory. The
handin must be received by 11:59pm on the day that the lab is due. You
can turn in as many times as you want. We will grade all your
submissions and email the result to you within a few minutes.

There will be no late hours. IAP leaves us with a very tight
schedule. Please contact the course staff if you have extenuating
cirumstances.

Code reviews
------------

Due to time constraints, there will be no peer code reviews.

Homework
--------

Other than the lab exercises, all homework assignments are **highly
recommended**, but will not count towards the final grade.

Collaboration
-------------

You are welcome to discuss the homework and labs with other students,
but all of your written work and code must be your own and must
carefully acknowledge all contributions of ideas by others, whether
from classmates or from sources you have read.

Do not post your lab or homework solutions on publicly accessible web
sites (such as GitHub) or file spaces (such as your Athena Public
directory).

Class meetings
--------------

Lectures will be held on Tuesday and Thursday from 7:00pm to 9:00pm in
37-212.
